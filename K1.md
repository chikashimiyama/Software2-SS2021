## FFT Objects
### fft~ und ifft~


![](k1/conversion.png)

Ifft ... inverse FFT.

FFT converts time domain data to frequency domain data  
IFFT converts frequency domain data to time domain data


### Assignment 1

in max the most basic objects for fft and ifft are [fft~] and [ifft~]. Learn those two objects and insert [fft~] and [ifft~] between the [cycle~ 440] and [ezdac~] in the patch below, in order to convert the time domain data to frequency domain and convert back the frequency domain data to time domain data. The output sound should be exactly the same as the original patch after the insertion.

Hint: [fft~] [ifft~] requires argument

### Assignment 2

use [capture~] and analyze the output coming from two outlets of [fft~] and observe the characteristics of the number printed on the Max console.

### Arguments for fft~ and ifft~ objects
- number of FFT samples ... The number of samples in the FFT it must be a power of two.
- spectral frame size ... the number of samples between successive FFTs. This must be at least the number of FFT samples and must be a power of two.



### What does [fft~] do exactly?

![](k1/slicing.png)

![](k1/bins.png)

This means 
- higher FFT size realizes the higher resolution in the spectrum data
- higher FFT size requires more samples to convert it to the frequency domain, thus it generates more delay
- The FFT size controls the trade-off between these two parameters

#### bin
Each sample output from fft~ represents the energy of frequency region.
First sample represents the energy from 0-86.1 Hz the next sample represents the energy from 86.1-172.2 Hz etc. We use a special term *bin* to express the samples in the frequency domain in order to distinguish it from the usual audio samples.

### Why does fft~ offer two outlets

### Complex plane
![](k1/complex.png)

The output from [fft~] can be plotted on a complex plane.

x = real  
y = imaginary

![](k1/real_imag.png)

In other words, we receive 512 points on the complex plane in one FFT block if the FFT size is 512.

### Summary

- [fft~] converts time domain data to frequency domain data
- [fft~] outputs two streams of numbers because frequency domain data is expressed as pairs of numbers; real and imaginary number
- the number of pairs output from fft~ at once depends on the size of FFT, and it should be a power of 2
- complex plane is useful to visualize those pairs of numbers


### How can we extract the data of spectrum from those two number (real - imaginary)?

### Assignment 3

The **distance** from the center of the complex plane and the points given by fft~ represents the energy of each frequency region.   
In the patch below, calculate the distance of each bin and visualize them in a waveform~ by storing them in a [buffer~ spectrum]

Hint 1: Pythagorean theorem  
Hint 2: the third outlet of fft~ outputs bin index from 0 to 511.  
Hint 3: [poke~] allows us to set a number in the specified buffer~ using signal

### The Problem : Phase aligned vs Phase unaligned Signal

### Assignment 4
When SR = 44100, How large is one frequency region that one FFT bin covers when FFT size is 512?  
When SR = 48000, How large is one frequency region that one FFT bin covers when FFT size is 1024?  
When SR = 96000, How large is one frequency region that one FFT bin covers when FFT size is 256?

### Assignment 5
Use the patch we created in assignment 3 and visualize the spectrum of sine waves whose frequency is multiple of the frequency region size. compare that with non-multiple of frequency region size.

### The cause of the problems observed in Assignment 5

![](k1/phase_problem.png)

The FFT algorithm assumes that the samples being analyzed comprise one cycle of periodic wave. If the frequency of the sine wave is aligned to the fundamental frequency of the FFT (512 samples in 44.1k = 86.1328 Hz) it works fine but in most cases, the 512 samples of the FFT will not be precisely one cycle of the wave. When that happens, the FFT still analyzes the 512 samples as if they were one cycle of a waveform, and reports the spectrum of that wave. Such as analysis will contain many spurious frequencies not actually present in the signal.

### The solution = Windowing

By applying windowing function (fadein-fadeout that is aligned to the size of FFT) we can make any kind of signal aligned signal. For that we usually use the hanning window.

### Assignment 6

Load the hanning.aiff to the patch of assignment 5, apply it to the signal before [fft~] and solve the problem.
