## K6. Spectral Delay und Decay

### Assignment 1: Spectral shifting
Each bin in pfft~ represents a spectral component of specific frequency range.
Theoretically, by displacing the spectral information of bin N to bin+1, we can realize a kind of pitch shifting effect. Implement this "shifting bins" idea in a fft~.

Hint: delay~

### Assignment 2: fbinshift~

[fbinshift~] objects allows us to do spectral shifting using frequency and it also enables the shift towards left (pitch down). Study the object [fbinshift~] and replace the delay~ used in the previous assignment.

### Assignment 3: Spectral scaling
Spectral shifting moves the entire spectrum left and right but theoretically we are also able to stretch or compress the spectral component. This is called spectral scaling. Implement the spectral scaling in a [pfft~] and make the scale factor controllable for the user
